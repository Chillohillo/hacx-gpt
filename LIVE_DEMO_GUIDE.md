## üé¨ Live Demo Script

### Introduction (2 minutes)

**Opening Statement:**
"Professor, today I'll demonstrate the theoretical risks associated with WiFi admin access, specifically focusing on how an attacker with network control could potentially monitor devices like children's iPhones. This is purely for educational purposes to understand network security risks."

**Key Points to Mention:**
- This is a theoretical demonstration
- Modern iOS devices have strong protections
- The goal is to understand attack vectors for defense

### Step 1: Network Discovery (3 minutes)

```bash
# Start the demo tool
python3 ios_wifi_exploit_demo.py

# Choose option 1: Scan Network for Devices
```

**What to Show:**
- Network scanning process
- Discovery of devices (iPhone, iPad, etc.)
- Device information (OS version, vulnerabilities)
- MAC addresses and hostnames

**Talking Points:**
- "As a WiFi admin, I can see all devices connected to the network"
- "This includes children's phones, tablets, and other IoT devices"
- "Each device reveals information about its operating system and potential vulnerabilities"

### Step 2: Man-in-the-Middle Attack (5 minutes)

```bash
# Choose option 3: Start ARP Poisoning (MITM)
# Enter target IP (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
```

**What to Demonstrate:**
- ARP poisoning process
- Traffic redirection through attacker
- Real-time packet interception simulation

**Talking Points:**
- "ARP poisoning allows me to redirect all traffic through my machine"
- "This means I can intercept communications between the child's iPhone and the internet"
- "Even encrypted traffic can be analyzed for metadata and patterns"

### Step 3: Exploit Simulation (4 minutes)

```bash
# Choose option 5: Simulate Exploit Attack
# Select CVE-2023-32434 (Kernel R/W)
# Enter target IP
```

**What to Show:**
- Exploit initialization process
- Security bypass attempts (ASLR, PAC, KTRR)
- Success/failure based on iOS version

**Talking Points:**
- "I'm attempting to exploit a known kernel vulnerability"
- "Notice how iOS 18.6 blocks the exploit - this shows the importance of updates"
- "Older iOS versions might be vulnerable to such attacks"

### Step 4: Surveillance Capabilities (3 minutes)

```bash
# Choose option 7: Demonstrate Surveillance Capabilities
```

**What to Demonstrate:**
- Screen recording capabilities (theoretical)
- Call monitoring
- Message interception
- Location tracking
- Camera/microphone access

**Talking Points:**
- "If successful, an attacker could theoretically access:"
- "Real-time screen recording of the child's phone"
- "Call logs and message history"
- "GPS location data"
- "Camera and microphone feeds"

### Step 5: Report Generation (2 minutes)

```bash
# Choose option 9: Generate Report
# Choose option 10: Save Report to File
```

**What to Show:**
- Comprehensive attack log
- Educational conclusions
- Security recommendations

**Talking Points:**
- "The report shows all attempted attacks and their outcomes"
- "This demonstrates the attack surface available to WiFi admins"
- "It also shows how modern security measures protect against these attacks"
