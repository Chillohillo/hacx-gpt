# Optional packages for enhanced functionality
# These are not strictly required but may be useful for advanced features

# For network scanning simulation (optional)
# scapy>=2.4.5  # Network packet manipulation
# netaddr>=0.8.0  # Network address manipulation

# For GUI enhancements (optional)
# pillow>=8.0.0  # Image processing for GUI
# matplotlib>=3.3.0  # Plotting for network visualization

# For report generation (optional)
# jinja2>=3.0.0  # Template engine for reports

# Note: The demonstration tools work with just the standard Python library
# The above optional packages are only needed if you want to extend functionality

# Installation instructions:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# 
# Or install only the core Python packages (which are usually pre-installed):
# python3 -c "import tkinter, json, datetime, threading, time, os, sys, argparse, typing; print('All core packages available')"
