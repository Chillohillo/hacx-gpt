    # Deduct points for vulnerabilities
    for vulnerability in device.vulnerabilities:
        if vulnerability.severity == 'Critical':
            base_score -= 25
        elif vulnerability.severity == 'High':
            base_score -= 20
        elif vulnerability.severity == 'Medium':
            base_score -= 15
        elif vulnerability.severity == 'Low':
            base_score -= 10
    
    return max(0, base_score)
