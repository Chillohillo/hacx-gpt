### üé≠ Live Demo Script for Professor

**Opening (2 minutes):**
"Professor, today I'll demonstrate why having admin access to home WiFi networks is extremely dangerous. This advanced toolkit shows how sophisticated attackers could compromise iOS devices, including children's phones, without any user interaction using cutting-edge exploit techniques."

**Demo Execution (10 minutes):**
1. Run: `python3 ios_advanced_exploit_demo.py --demo`
2. Explain each phase as it executes:
   - **Phase 1**: Evasion and Stealth Techniques
   - **Phase 2**: Advanced Kernel Exploitation via 802.11
   - **Phase 3**: Encrypted Command & Control Setup
   - **Phase 4**: Advanced Persistence Installation
   - **Phase 5**: Stealth Cleanup and Trace Removal

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
- "This demonstrates complete device compromise without user interaction"
- "The attacker uses encrypted communication to avoid detection"
- "Kernel-level persistence survives reboots and updates"
- "Children's devices are particularly vulnerable to these techniques"

**Conclusion (3 minutes):**
"Professor, this demonstration proves that admin access to WiFi networks creates severe security risks. The ability to compromise iOS devices with sophisticated kernel exploits, encrypted communication, and persistent backdoors shows why we need better security education and stronger network protection measures."
